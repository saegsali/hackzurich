#12 CORONA SCARE APPLICATION

The corona pandemic map of Johns Hopkins university is well known. We would like to go a step beyond and find a way to map the impact of the virus on people's emotions: How upset are they? How threatened do they feel, how scared? Assuming that there is a correlation between how scared people are and how many news (faked or real news) are posted around them, we define the "Corona Scare Level" in an area as proportional to the number of corona related news that pop up in that same area.
